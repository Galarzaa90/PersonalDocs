# blog init

Hello! I have been considering writing a blog for a long time, but I always end up talking myself out of it.

- "No one will even read it."
- "What are you even going to write about on it?"
- "Who even reads blogs anymore?"

Well, I believe the first step is the hardest one, so here it is!

## What to expect?

This blog is part of my [personal documentation site](../../index.md), where I collect notes, bookmarks, tech setups, and other scattered things I find useful or interesting.

In the same spirit, the blog will be a place to capture ideas that don’t quite fit elsewhere. Less structured, more personal.

Topics will probably include software development, gaming, electronics, and whatever else I feel like sharing.

## Why a blog?

I’ve been keeping personal docs for a while, mostly to save things like command-line snippets, setup instructions, and notes I'd rather not lose.

But sometimes an idea is too big for a checklist and too small for a full repo. I wanted a space that sits in between, something more flexible, where I can write without needing a clear structure or purpose.

That’s where this blog fits.
