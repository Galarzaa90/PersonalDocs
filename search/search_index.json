I figured it was time to buy my own router. I didn't buy anything fancy, I went with a Huawei WiFi AX3.</p> <p>I must add that, due to our current house layout, we are not using ethernet (I know... I know...). That will change once we are able to build our office/game room, but that's another story.</p> <p>I installed it, configured, loved it. I thought, now if I switch ISPs or they need to change my router for some reason, I don't have to do any changes in my devices, since they will always be connected to the router. Or at least that's what I thought...</p> <p>I have always been a bit annoyed by routers having two SSID, one for 2.4 GHz and one for 5 GHz, because you see twice as many networks everywhere, so when I saw the option to have a single SSID that offers both, I immediately turned that on. It was pretty nice, my phone wouldn't randomly lose WiFi on the second floor because it lost connection to the 5 GHz and connected to the 2.4 GHz one. Changing it required reconnecting every device at home to the new network, once again... but I figured it was worth it.</p> <p>The change was a bit harder on some IoT devices, like lightbulbs, because they can only connect to 2.4 GHz, so some would keep saying it was a 5 GHz network.</p>","tags":["Nintendo Switch","Troubleshooting","Networking"]},{"location":"blog/2025/08/01/networking-beginner-vs-nintendo-switch/#finding-a-solution","title":"Finding a solution","text":"<p>The first step was to again split the WiFi network into separate SSIDs for each band.

I grabbed my Switch and I noticed I was still not seeing the 5 GHz network... but I still could see other networks, and my phone was able to see and connect to my 5 GHz network. I also tried the \"Backup Wi-Fi 5\" option, which creates Wi-Fi 5 networks for devices that can't discover Wi-Fi 6 networks, but no luck.</p> <p>So it was time to resort to Google to find a solution. Oddly enough I ended up finding some answers in a deals community (Mexican version of Pepper). Basically the issue was that Nintendo Switch can only see WiFi channels under 149, and my router was using exactly channel 149.</p> <p>I changed that to channel 36, and some seconds later, the 5 GHz network showed up on my Switch. I connected to it and ran a speedtest from my Switch, and got around 30 Mbps. Not quite what I expected... but I guess I cannot ask much from Nintendo, so I considered that a win.</p> <p>I wrapped everything up, set up every device in my house to connect to the new network, grumbling my way through the process.</p> <p>Later that night, my wife tested Pokemon Unite again, and her lag problem was finally solved.</p>","tags":["Nintendo Switch","Troubleshooting","Networking"]},{"location":"blog/2025/08/01/networking-beginner-vs-nintendo-switch/#final-thoughts","title":"Final thoughts","text":"<p>Turns out the real problem wasn\u2019t bandwidth, or interference, or streaming \u2014 it was just the Switch being picky about WiFi channels.</p> <p>Annoying?

However, at my previous job, I was provided with a MacBook. One of the things I enjoyed from it was the Spotlight feature (Cmd+Space). So when I saw that Power Toys had a similar tool, I gave it a try.</p> <p></p> <p>Definitely not as pretty as Spotlight... but still very handy.</p> <p>The default shortcut is Ctrl+Space, and you can start typing immediately. I personally use it mostly as a quick calculator and sometimes as a quick search.</p> <p>The way this works is by using plugins. It comes with plenty of bundled plugins, and for each of them, you can decide whether you want it to be included in global results or require an activation command. For example, the activation command for Windows Settings is <code>$</code>, and it is not set to Include in global results, so I need to put <code>$</code> at the beginning in order to show results from this plugin.</p> <p></p> <p>This way you can select which plugins always show results and which one require explicit intent, so you don't end up with way too many results. For example, I have the Calculator plugin included in results, so I can just type <code>5+5</code> and get the answer. I can then press Enter to copy the result to the clipboard.</p> <p>These are my main plugins</p> <ul> <li>Calculator: Sometimes I just want quick math on the spot, and being able to copy it to the clipboard is amazing.</li> <li>Unit Converter: Very similar to Calculator, but for unit conversions. Saves me the trouble of using Google. Although it is a shame that it doesn't include currency conversion.</li> <li>Windows Search: Searches files and folders. I don't use this as often, because I usually rely on Everything.</li> <li>Program: Searches programs, so you can use this as an application launcher.</li> </ul> <p>Other plugins worth mentioning:</p> <ul> <li>Value Generator: I'm gonna be honest here, I didn't know this one existed, but this looks very handy if you are a developer. It can generate UUIDs, encode and decode URLs, MD5, sha256, etc.</li> <li>Windows Terminal: Shortcut to open Windows Terminal profiles.</li> <li>Window Walker: This one seems very handy, I have tried it a couple of times, but doesn't seem like my style. It lets you search among your open windows to jump to them.</li> </ul> <p>You can also install third-party plugins. There are some in the GitHub Repository.
